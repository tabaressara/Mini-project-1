# Mini-project-1  
**Sara Tabares**

This project involved changing the tone of a trailer for an upcoming movie or video game. The trailer for the movie *The Roses*, which was originally a comedy, was chosen and transformed into a romantic drama.

The trailer was in English, which complicated the modification of the audio. Therefore, the script was completely rewritten, changing the tone and content of the dialogues to adapt it to the new genre. The actors' voices were generated using an artificial intelligence tool (Fish Audio), and the audio was edited in **Audacity**. In this process, the components of the original audio (instruments, bass, drums, and vocals) were separated, allowing the desired sounds to be extracted.

In addition, some sound effects were incorporated to enhance the experience, such as a dog barking, the sound of something frying in the kitchen, and spray on the face. The pitch and speed of some audio fragments were adjusted to match the image.

Finally, the audio was exported as an MP3 file and, using **Adobe Premiere Pro**, the sound and image were merged to obtain the final result.
